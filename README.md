OOP PROJECTS ‚Äì Recipe & User Manager

Hey! üëã

I made these two small Python projects to practice object-oriented programming (OOP). They are simple but very helpful for learning how classes, objects, and methods work together.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Recipe Manager

This project lets me add and display recipes. I can:

Enter a recipe with its name, ingredients, cooking time, and instructions.

Display the recipe neatly on the screen.


Everything is simple, just for practice, but it helped me understand how objects store data and how I can call methods to display it.

How to run:

.Run it in terminal or IDE

2Ô∏è‚É£ Simple User Input

This project is about entering and displaying user information. I can:

Enter first name, last name, email, and password.

Display the information neatly.


It‚Äôs very basic but helped me practice creating a class and using objects.

What I learned

How to define classes and constructors.

How to store data in objects.

How to create methods to display information.

How to handle user input properly.

Things I know could be better

Currently, data is not saved after the program exits. Maybe next step I‚Äôll add file storage.

Passwords are stored as plain text (not safe for real apps!).

I used time.sleep() in Recipe Manager just to make it feel nicer, but it slows things down a little.

My thoughts

Both projects are simple, but they helped me get comfortable with OOP in Python.
